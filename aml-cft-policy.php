                    <p>Article 1 Purposes and Basis. In view of the fact that money laundering will undermine the development of digital asset trading, facilitate and breed corruption, pollute social morality, damage the legitimate rights and interests of Users, destroy the foundation for the sound operation of digital assets trading Platforms, increase the legal and operational risks of digital assets trading Platforms, KuCoin formulates these Rules in accordance with the User Agreement of the KuCoin Website, the User Agreement of the Hasla APP and other relevant documentation, so as to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing and fully comply with relevant regulations against money laundering and terrorist financing. By the very nature of its businesses, Hasla will have a portfolio of clients across the globe. This international presence may trigger queries or requests for information from other law enforcement authorities. KuCoin shall therefore abide to the different laws and legal requirements imposed by the authorities in Seychelles. These rules outline the procedures to be followed in order to prevent money laundering, terrorist financing and corruption. KuCoin does not wish to be manipulated by money launderers or terrorists or to become associated with money laundering or terrorism in general. Its aim is not merely to comply with its legal obligations, but to effectively minimise the risk of exploitation by criminals. Thus, the anti-money laundering, terrorist financing and corruption policies are based on the requisite highest standards.</p>
                    <p>Article 2 Scope of Application. These Rules shall apply to all Users trading on the Hasla website and the APP thereof (hereinafter referred to as "the Platform"). The Users shall implement the provisions of these Rules in accordance with the anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing laws and regulations of the country or region where they are located and within the scope prescribed by the laws and regulations of the region or country where they are located. Where there are stricter requirements in the country or region where the Users are located, such requirements shall prevail. These rules are governed by and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of Seychelles.</p>
                    <p>Article 3 Fight Against Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing. This refers to activities with respect to which measures have been adopted pursuant to relevant laws, relevant rules and regulations, for the purpose of preventing money laundering activities that are carried out by offenders through the Platform for the purpose of covering up and concealing the source and nature of the proceeds and profits that such offenders obtain through such crimes as those relating to narcotics, organized crimes, terrorism, smuggling, graft, bribery, financial fraud, breach of financial regulation and order, inter alia.</p>
                    <p>Article 4 The Platform’s Rules and Regulations against Money Laundering.

In the event of any conflict between these Rules and Measures for the Management of Large-sum Transactions and the OTC Platform Guidelines for Users against Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing, such measures and guidelines shall prevail.</p>

                    <p>Article 18 Identification of High-risk Users. High-risk Users refers to Users who comprise any of the following high-risk factors and are identified as high-risk Users after a comprehensive evaluation by the Hasla Platform. High-risk Users include:</p>

Should there be any change or abnormality in such identity or status, or the Hasla Platform becomes suspicious about any of the information that it has by then obtained on the User, the Hasla Platform will re-identify the User identity and adjust the risk level grading of the User in a timely manner. The Hasla Platform has the discretion to adjust the User’s risk level grading and may do so without providing the User with any reason.</p>
                    <p>Article 22 Monitoring of High-risk Users. For Users in the high-risk category, the Hasla Platform will conduct a review every six months to update the basic information on the Users’ identity and ascertain their sources of funding, use of funds, financial standing or business status. If the Hasla Platform, on the basis of a comprehensive assessment during the regular review of a high-risk User, deems that the User and the transactions in the User’s account with the Hasla Platform are normal, it may lower the risk level of such User.</p>
                    <p>Article 23 Continuous User Identification.

                    <p>(1) dispersed transfer-in of digital assets followed by collective transfer-out thereof within a short period of time, or collective transfer-in followed by dispersed transfer-out within a short period of time, which is clearly inconsistent with the User’s identity, financing standing and/or business operation status;</p>
                    <p>(2) where an account that has been inactive for a long time is suddenly reactivated, or there is a sudden abnormal in-flow of digital assets in an account with usually small amounts of digital asset flow, and a large amount of currency is withdrawn within a short period of time;</p>
                    <p>(3) where a large number of accounts are opened or cancelled without any justifiable reason, and a large amount of currency is deposited or withdrawn prior to such cancellation of accounts;</p>
                    <p>(4) there is any suspicious lump-sum deposit or withdrawal in the account of an User who is a natural person;</p>
                    <p>(5) where the User engages in excessively frequent trading within a certain period of time, which is seriously inconsistent with the situation on the digital assets market;</p>
                    <p>(6) and other suspicious trading situations identified by the Hasla Platform.</p>
                    <p>Article 27 Identification of Terrorist Financing.

                    <p>Article 32 Assistance to Judicial Investigation.

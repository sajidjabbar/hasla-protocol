                    <p>We use cookies and similar tools to enhance your user experience, provide our services, and understand how customers use our services so we can make improvements. Depending on applicable laws in the region you are located in, the cookie banner on your browser will tell you how to accept or refuse cookies.</p>
                    <h3>4. Does Hasla Share My Personal Information?</h3>
                    <p>Information about our users is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling our users' personal information to others. Hasla shares users' personal information only as described below and with the subsidiaries or affiliates of Hasla that are either subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.</p>
                    <p>Third party service providers: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include analysing data, providing marketing assistance, processing payments, transmitting content, and assessing and managing credit risk. These third-party service providers only have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Further, they must process the personal information in accordance with our contractual agreements and only as permitted by applicable data protection laws.</p>
                    <p>Business transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the user consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Binance or substantially all of its assets are acquired, user information will be one of the transferred assets.</p>
                    <p>Protection of Hasla and others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law or with our regulatory obligations; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of Hasla, our users or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
                    <h3>5. International transfers of personal data</h3>
                    <p>Hasla may transfer your data outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Hasla puts in place suitable technical, organizational and contractual safeguards (including Standard Contractual Clauses), to ensure that such transfer is carried out in compliance with applicable data protection rules, except where the country to which the data is transferred has already been determined by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of protection.</p>
                    <h3>6. How Secure is My Information?</h3>
                    <p>We design our systems with your security and privacy in mind. We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by using encryption protocols and software.</p>
                    <p>We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of your personal information. Our security procedures mean that we may ask you to verify your identity to protect you against unauthorised access to your account password. We recommend using a unique password for your Hasla account that is not utilized for other online accounts and to sign off when you finish using a shared computer.</p>
                    <h3>7. What About Advertising?</h3>
                    <p>In order for us to provide you the best user experience, we may share your personal information with our marketing partners for the purposes of targeting, modeling, and/or analytics as well as marketing and advertising. You may opt-out of sharing personal information with our marketing partners, unless we have a legitimate interest to do so.</p>
                    <h3>8. What Information Can I Access?</h3>

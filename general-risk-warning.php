                    <h3>G. Liquidity risk</h3>
                    <p>Digital Assets may have limited liquidity which may make it difficult or impossible for you to sell or exit a position when you wish to do so. This may occur at any time, including at times of rapid price movements.</p>

                    <h3>K. Security Risk</h3>
                    <p>It is not possible for Binance to eliminate all security risks.
